Known Issues
============

-  Reading order is determined by the model based on the spatial
   distribution of readable content, and may be out of order in some
   areas under extremely complex layouts.
-  Vertical text is not supported.
-  Tables of contents and lists are recognized through rules, and some
   uncommon list formats may not be recognized.
-  Only one level of headings is supported; hierarchical headings are
   not currently supported.
-  Code blocks are not yet supported in the layout model.
-  Comic books, art albums, primary school textbooks, and exercises
   cannot be parsed well.
-  Table recognition may result in row/column recognition errors in
   complex tables.
-  OCR recognition may produce inaccurate characters in PDFs of
   lesser-known languages (e.g., diacritical marks in Latin script,
   easily confused characters in Arabic script).
-  Some formulas may not render correctly in Markdown.
